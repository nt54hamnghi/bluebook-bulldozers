The plot of the mean price grouped by the manufactured year (`YearMade`) indicates that, except the 1920-1960 timeframe, the more recent a machine is produced, the higher its expected sale price. 

However, the average price and the number of machines made suddenly dropped from 2008 moving forwards. It is probably due to the 2008 financial crisis. 

Also, several abnormal spikes appear from 1920 to 1960, which coule be concerning, but it's just the result of the lack of data points. The boxplot helps justify this; the points between 1920 and 1960 are all outliers.
