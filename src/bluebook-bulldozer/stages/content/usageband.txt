`UsageBand` tells the usage of a machine compared to the average usage of the products in the same model line (`fiBaseModel`). The possible values are "high", "medium", and "low". For example, a model-X machine having "low" usage means its usage is below the average of all machines of model X.

The box plot (on the left) shows that as the usage move from "low" to "medium" and then "high," the mean sale price increase accordingly. 

However, as shown in the histogram, most bulldozers have a "medium" UsageBand, and when the log of sale price is above the 10, these machines take up the highest proportion.
